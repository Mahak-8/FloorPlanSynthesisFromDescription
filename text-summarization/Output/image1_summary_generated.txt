Coming back to the first room, the door on the front room takes us to an empty room of the same size as the first room.Left to the room is a door which opens up to a comparatively smaller room which has a dining table and sink in it.The main room has another door in upper front which opens up to an open area which has a door in its left connecting to a bathroom with a bathtub present in it.The house basically has three partitions, bathroom, dining room, and a combined main hall and bedroom.The bathroom is in the top-left side, dining hall in the bottom left side and the bedroom in the bottom right side.
